# ASD project


The project consists of several .py files and aims to mine the repo https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow. 

The question the project must answer is: 

Which 10 developers have made the most commits aimed at fixing vulnerabilities? A commit can be considered to have fixed vulnerabilities if its message contains the word "fix" and one of the words "security," "vulnerability," or "vulnerabilities."
